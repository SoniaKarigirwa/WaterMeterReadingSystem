# WaterMeterReadingSystem
Water Meter Digitization project aims to streamline water meter reading processes by digitizing
traditional mechanical meters using OpenCV and Python.
By capturing images of the meters, processing them to extract text with OpenCV, and storing the readings in
a database, the system automates the reading process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
